press all six central buttons from left to right, release them from left to right. Multiple tries, but 
unfortunately, I didn't manage to keep all of them pressed at the same time (some button is always released 
too early...);
remove pen, eraser, pen from left to right; put back pen, eraser, pen from left to right.
